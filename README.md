# 🔬 MEDI-SCAN: AI-Powered Medical Image Analysis for Ocular Disease Diagnosis
MediScan is an AI-driven system designed to automate the diagnosis of ocular diseases using retinal fundus images. By harnessing the power of deep learning and computer vision, this project offers a scalable, non-invasive solution to detect critical eye conditions such as:
Cataract \
Glaucoma \
Diabetic Retinopathy \
Normal Retina 

# 🚀 Key Features:
✅ Automated Multi-Class Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).  \
📊 Model Performance Visualization with accuracy/loss graphs, confusion matrices.   \
📁 Preprocessed and augmented image datasets to improve model robustness and generalization.  \
💡 Real-time prediction interface.   

# 🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python, TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)   \
OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn    \
Streamlit   \
Jupyter Notebooks for training and experimentation  

# 🎯 Objective:
To democratize access to retinal diagnostics by providing a fast, accurate, and interpretable deep learning-based solution — potentially aiding early detection and treatment, especially in remote or resource-limited regions.
